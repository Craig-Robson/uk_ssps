# UK SSP's datasets
Data from the UK SSPs in spatial formats. All data available in the geopackage (.gpkg) format. 

A number of datasets are available, but this is not an extensive list, with more datasets being added over the coming months covering further SSP variables and different levels of disaggregation for all variables where possible.
